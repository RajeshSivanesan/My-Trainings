Hypothesis Test (assumption, these are not facts)
There are 2 hypothesis or AB testing
types - null and alternative hypothesis
here we disprove and not prove a fact

null hypothesis - H0- example - coin is Fair (probability is equal for all options)
(everything goes right, what could be the null hypothesis)

Alternate - opp of null hypothesis - h1 or hA
coin is biased
coin has biased on one side of coin

null can be equal to a value
alternate can be <> or not equal to

if having less than sign - lower tail is used
if having greater than sign - higher tail is used
if having not equal - two tail tests

the gap between two critical points is called as confidence level
alpha is called as the level of significance - with which the decision is made.

confidence interval
this much confidence the actual will occur within the range
for ex 95% confidence level

Inferential techniques
z, t tests - sample distribution with means 
chi-squared, F - based on variance.

hypothesis testing steps
 - calculate null and alternate hypothesis
 - choose the level of significance - level which we reject the null hypothesis
 - find critical values - act as boundary
 - find test statistic - sample based that is used for test.
 - Draw your conclusion - reject the null or accept hypothesis.

Z-test assumptions
population SD is known
Sample size should be greater than 30
something measurable is called on continous - it should be a number (discrete is countable)

T-test
sample size is less than 30
population SD or variance is not known - found on 1908
continuous interval ratio.

same formula as Z-test, just replace SD of population to the SD of sample size.

Degree of Freedom:
when estimating mean or proportion of single sample, independent observations is n-1
