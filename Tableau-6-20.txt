How do to publish - or access our dashboard

we are going to create a own web server,
they can embed their dashboard as a iframe with their content.
this makes for easier conception

talk to ui team and understand the best possible combination or layouts

we prefer to use Range and get the max and min values from the ui team and 
create dashboards for that.

how do we drag and drop and follows floating
tiled or
floating layout

make sure we have tiled layout as our pattern
to arrange tiles in meaningful way, we can use containers

its just a placeholder for the sheet
we do have horizontal or vertical container.

Horizontal container
if we have two visualizations next to each other
then we should be within a horizontal container
one above the other, use a vertical container.

we can have both on the same dashboard as well.
Distribute contents equally - automatically adjust the horizontal items in the container
to evenly take space
post that we wont be alter width

to make the full space to be occupied by the sheet, use Fit -> Fit entire view

if a vizualization like doughut sheet we might have done very big
if so, just go to sheet -> reduce size and remove header also
u will get a better fit.

reducing size automatically reduces the dashboard also.

how do we bring interactivity
action filter
is for which we have for interactivity
specific to tableau - dont hit data source

click on the sheet and choose as use as filter to bring that
if clicking the specific item it will filter all the sheets related to that.
to undo, click on the same item it removes the use as filter.

three ways of doing action filter
hover - hove on the item
select - on selecting the item itself
menu - shows a filter name as menu, click on it to get the filter

clearing the selection
on unclick, show all the values which means is that it goes to the full state
or keep the filtered values - it will retain the items which satisfies filter condition
or exclude all the values - the sheet goes off - this is the concept for show or hide.
if i unclick it
interactivity can be used here, on click only show or hide a sheet. Exclude important option

try to understand this interactivity after applying the dhoni data set. LEarn it today

always do a relationship of filters - parent - child and not child to parent
or else the reason we created is getting disturbed.

we can use a Page Pane for creating a video visualization 
to give a view of how it increased or decreased

we can share the dashboard by story
we get the html for the website to load into a iframe
which will have all interactivity.
